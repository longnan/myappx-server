Font Configuration for PDF Generation
========================================

This directory contains font files that will be embedded in PDF documents
generated by the application.

SYSTEM CONFIGURATION
--------------------
To enable font embedding in PDFs, configure the following environment variable:

    PDF_FONT_DIR=/opt/idempiere-server/data/fonts

This path should point to the directory containing the font files (.ttf, .otf, etc.)
that you want to use for PDF generation.

NOTES
-----
- Place your font files (.ttf, .otf, .woff, etc.) in this directory
- Ensure the application has read permissions for this directory
- Restart the application after adding new fonts
- Supported font formats may vary depending on the PDF generation library
